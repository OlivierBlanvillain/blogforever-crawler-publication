<div> All with lighted lanterns, adults and children gathered in a corner of the school site. Slightly embarrassed parents and restless children. Before setting out, one of the teachers outlined the suggested process following song and careful walking. We (struggled) to practice songs and then set out.
Well, I can only reflect on my observations. Gradually, a hush descended on us all as the parents became increasingly attentive to their children. An amazing mood of gentle caring and concern gradually opened up, demonstrated by (unhurried and uncritical attention) to mud and clothes for example. At the same time, the children could give voice to their own direct experiences. You may know the paintings of Joseph Wright of Derby. These give a pale image of what could be discovered then.
This, people were left quite free to make their own discoveries. Interestingly, a child within earshot saw various electrically powered lights on houses, a car and a bicycle (on a public road) and commented “They’re cheating” on several occasions.
As an adult, I’m surprised and disappointed at the rapid fading of such experiences into memory. Speaking personally, i spend much more time in the company of other human beings and sunlight than i do in the world of experiment. For personal reasons, I reckon my connection with technology has been rather closer…
*sip” Do you have another of those ice creams, Alicia? Great. Thanks. i can see it is getting darker and we will soon need to pack up leave in our separate directions. Ah! Problem. i can only pay you in ethereal £. Did you expect to receive euros?
So, to sum up, i reckoned one aspect of the St. Martin’s Festival was a celebration among human beings. Somehow, this manifest and subtle dimension is often neglected in life.
Striving to promote the well-being of vulnerable people, i’m frequently caught up with contradictions in “care”. While health professionals may use information from the British National Formulary to support their clinical decisions, this “digest for rapid reference”. As noted, in p. iii of the September 2010 edition: “The BNF should be interpreted in the light of professional knowledge and supplemented as necessary by specialised publications and by reference to the product literature.”
This statement may be taken widely as a sensibly safe and conservative view of the academic, professional and scientific position. Yet, once again, what happens next, following references to the BNF? Well, much of this accepted usage lies in a carefully controlled human domain. Is mental health different? Fortunately for me as a consumer, the BNF gives careful, highly detailed and technical information about products.
Clearly, such explanations provide an essential basis for scientific medicine and support appropriate innovation. Several years ago, i applied for registration at the then London University School of Pharmacy to pursue postgraduate research into themes of exercise and effectiveness as relating to treatment and effectiveness. At that time, I was frustrated that my application was unsuccessful. Having reflected for several years, i have concluded that this evidence points to the possibility that the “human” dimension is excluded from what i may call the “bnf.org” approach. Of course, I accept that the situation may have changed since 2010.
To me, this seems very well until the dimension of polypharmacy is considered. Here, i should make clear my own situation. While a social scientist and not a health professional, this theme was brought to my notice several years ago by a health professional. Aware of my advocacy activities, he suggested that i should carry our research into “polypharmacy” and “treatment and recovery”. Having done this, i wonder whether the biographical (in vivo?) aspect is accounted for in the same way as the statistical aspect.
In many ways, this awareness of boundaries would also suggest agreement upon limitations. For example in England-UK, media coverage of a recent NICE decision sparked some interest. By removing recognition of exercise from its remit, it was seen as acting out of harmony with general opinion. Yet, accepting the above method, the decision is quite consistent. While not qualified to say so as David Clark, this does not seem in any way to be “improbable science”.
Yet, i can still hear the TV announcer say “But what happens next?” A great deal of discipline and rigour have been dedicated towards ensuring the effectiveness and safety of medicines. Clearly, one can only be pleased that such endeavours continue. Yet some vulnerable people have a complex biographical and product history in this area. From experience, i know that they struggle in many ways, some in long term institutions. Looking in from outside, i reckon exercise and fresh air in various forms may enliven. Sometimes, i’m saddened that justified recognition of clinical standards may be accompanied by this more challenging human dimension.
Sorry, Alicia. i haven’t finished yet. In the circumstances, i’ll get on with other tasks and meet you in the ethereal departure lounge for some parting remarks on gnomes and international relations. Hope you can wait. Bye. </div>
