Blogs are by nature a very dynamic and volatile communication medium. The BlogForever project aims to provide a generic platform for blog preservation, thus ensuring access to this information to future generations. This paper presents a key component of this archiving system: the web crawler. More precisely, our discussion will concentrate on techniques to automatically extract content, authors, date and comments of blog posts. One of the main challenges in the preservation of web objects is the rapid evolution of technologies. For instance, the recent trend towards using JavaScript to dynamically generate pages on the client side constitutes a new obstacle for today's crawlers. We will show how we integrated a web browser into the harvesting process in order to address these matters. Furthermore, we present a simple and robust algorithm based on string matching between web feeds and page content to generate wrappers. Being applicable to all posts of a blog, the resulting extraction procedure scales for large blogs.
