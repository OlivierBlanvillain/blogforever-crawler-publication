Blogs are by nature a very dynamic and volatile communication medium. The
BlogForever project aims to provide a generic platform for blog preservation.
This paper presents a key component of this archiving system: the Web Crawler.
More precisely, our discussion will concentrate on techniques to automaticaly
extract content, authors, date and comments of blog posts.

Web technologies are evolving very rapidly. The recent trend toward using
JavaScript to dynamically generate pages on the client side represent a new
challenge for the web crawler. We will show how we integrated the headless web
browser into the our spider to overcome these obstacles.

We present a simple and robust algorithm based on string similarity to build
wrappers from web feeds. Being applicable to all posts of a blog, the
resulting extraction procedure scale for large blogs.
