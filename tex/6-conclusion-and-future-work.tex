\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
% What we presented, what we solved
In this paper, we presented the internals of the BlogForever web crawler. Its central article extraction procedure based on extraction rules generation was introduced along with theoretical and empirical evidences validating the approach. Simple adaptation of this procedure allowed to extract different types of contents, including authors, dates and comments. In order to support 

blogs with JavaScript generated content 

We also discussed the overall software architecture, highlighting the design choices made to achieve both modularity and scalability. 


% Future work

Plan:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Recap the problem and the objective
  \item Summarize how've solved it
  \item Mention challenges and problems
  \item Hint for future work
\end{enumerate}

Content:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Web pages dynamically generated after filling a web form/doing some user action. This is not automated atm.
  \item Spacial reasoning (we already have the page rendered w PhantomJS)
  \item Low level PhantomJS hooks
  \item Tree edit distance matching
\end{enumerate}
