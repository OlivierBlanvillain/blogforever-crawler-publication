\section{Evaluation}

Our evaluation will be articulated in two parts. Firstly, we will compare the content extraction procedure presented in section \ref{algorithms} with three open source projects capable of generically extract content from web articles. The comparison will show that our blog targeted solution has better performances both in term of running time and success rates. Secondly, a discussion will be held regarding the different solutions available to archive data beyond what is available in HTML source code. Extraction of authors, dates and comments is not part of evaluation because of the lack of publicly available competing projects and reference data sets.

\subsection{Content extraction Precision}
To evaluate of post content and title extraction we compared our approach to three open source projects: Readability\cite{}, Boilerpipe\cite{kohlschuetter2010} and Goose\cite{}. Implemented in Javascript, Java and Scala respectively, all three offer the same functionality: given an HTML web page, extract it's main textual content. These projects are more generic than our blog specific approach in the sense that they do not make use of web feeds and do not exploit structural similarities of pages of a blog (assuptions \ref{havefeedAssum} and \ref{similarhtmlAssum}). Readability works by .... Boilerpipe uses a very .... Goose implements a more sofisticated algorithm which ....

\subsection{Content running time}

% rsetup (single core, gc disabled, measure time spent in respective extraction functions)
% result (plot)

% discussion: we are "cheating" on scalability
% discussion: raw perf (15 feed entry)
% discussion: (c++ vs java vs scala vs go \cite{hundt2011})

\subsection{JavaScript rendering}

% intro, plan (why we pick these projects, what we want to show with this evaluation)
