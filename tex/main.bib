	abstract = {The evolution of the web has outpaced itself: A growing wealth of information and increasingly sophisticated interfaces necessitate automated processing, yet existing automation and data extraction technologies have been overwhelmed by this very growth. To address this trend, we identify four key requirements for web data extraction, automation, and (focused) web crawling: (1) interact with sophisticated web application interfaces, (2) precisely capture the relevant data to be extracted, (3) scale with the number of visited pages, and (4) readily embed into existing web technologies. We introduce {OXPath} as an extension of {XPath} for interacting with web applications and extracting data thus revealed--matching all the above requirements. {OXPath's} page-at-a-time evaluation guarantees memory use independent of the number of visited pages, yet remains polynomial in time. We experimentally validate the theoretical complexity and demonstrate that {OXPath's} resource consumption is dominated by page rendering in the underlying browser. With an extensive study of sublanguages and properties of {OXPath}, we pinpoint the effect of specific features on evaluation performance. Our experiments show that {OXPath} outperforms existing commercial and academic data extraction tools by a wide margin.},

	abstract = {Web feeds, either in {RSS} or Atom {XML-based} formats, are evolving descriptive documents that characterize a dynamic hub of a Web site and help subscribers keep up with what is the most recent Web content of interest. In this paper, we show how Web feeds can be useful instruments for information extraction and Web page change detection. Web pages referenced by feed items are usually blog posts or news articles, data with a dynamic (then ephemeral) nature and which is clustered topically in a feed channel. We monitor Web channels and extract from the associated Web pages the text and references corresponding to Web articles. The result is enriched with the timestamp and additional metadata mined from the feed, and encapsulated in a 'data object'. The data object will be in particular information devoided of all the template elements or advertisements. These irrelevant elements, generically called boileplate, are not only consuming time and space from the crawler's point of view, but also hinder the data analysis process. We first make some statistics on a set of Web feeds, by crawling them for a period of time and observing their temporal aspects. Then we present the algorithm used for article extraction, algorithm that uses the feed semantics (more specifically the description and title of feed items) in order to identify the {DOM} node in the {HTML} page that contains the article. The data objects constructed in this way can be used as a semantic overlay collection for an archive or in the context of an incremental crawl, making it more efficient by detecting change at data object level. Experiments on the extraction technique are done in order to validate our approach, with good results even in cases when other techniques fail. We finally discuss useful applications based on the extraction and change detection of Web objects.},

	abstract = {This paper studies structured data extraction from Web pages. Existing approaches to data extraction include wrapper induction and automated methods. In this paper, we propose an instance-based learning method, which performs extraction by comparing each new instance to be extracted with labeled instances. The key advantage of our method is that it does not require an initial set of labeled pages to learn extraction rules as in wrapper induction. Instead, the algorithm is able to start extraction from a single labeled instance. Only when a new instance cannot be extracted does it need labeling. This avoids unnecessary page labeling, which solves a major problem with inductive learning (or wrapper induction), i.e., the set of labeled instances may not be representative of all other instances. The instance-based approach is very natural because structured data on the Web usually follow some fixed templates. Pages of the same template usually can be extracted based on a single page instance of the template. A novel technique is proposed to match a new instance with a manually labeled instance and in the process to extract the required data items from the new instance. The technique is also very efficient. Experimental results based on 1,200 pages from 24 diverse Web sites demonstrate the effectiveness of the method. It also outperforms the state-of-the-art existing systems significantly.},

This boilerplate text typically is not related to the main content, may deteriorate search precision and thus needs to be detected properly. In this paper, we analyze a small set of shallow text features for classifying the individual text elements in a Web page. We compare the approach to complex, state-of-the-art techniques and show that competitive accuracy can be achieved, at almost no cost. Moreover, we derive a simple and plausible stochastic model for describing the boilerplate creation process. With the help of our model, we also quantify the impact of boilerplate removal to retrieval performance and show significant improvements over the baseline. Finally, we extend the principled approach by straight-forward heuristics, achieving a remarkable detection accuracy.},

Tools used currently by Web archivists blindly crawl and store Web pages found while crawling, disregarding the kind of Web site currently accessed (which leads to suboptimal crawling strategies) and whatever structured content is contained in Web pages (which results in page-level archives whose content is hard to exploit). We focus in this {PhD} work on the crawling and archiving of publicly accessible Web applications, especially those of the social Web. A Web application is any application that uses Web standards such as {HTML} and {HTTP} to publish information on the Web, accessible by Web browsers. Examples include Web forums, social networks, geolocation services, etc. We claim that the best strategy to crawl these applications is to make the Web crawler aware of the kind of application currently processed, allowing it to refine the list of {URLs} to process, and to annotate the archive with information about the structure of crawled content. We add adaptive characteristics to an archival Web crawler: being able to identify when a Web page belongs to a given Web application and applying the appropriate crawling and content extraction methodology.},

	abstract = {Web Data Extraction is an important problem that has been studied by means of different scientific tools and in a broad range of application domains. Many approaches to extracting data from the Web have been designed to solve specific problems and operate in ad-hoc application domains. Other approaches, instead, heavily reuse techniques and algorithms developed in the field of Information Extraction. This survey aims at providing a structured and comprehensive overview of the research efforts made in the field of Web Data Extraction. The fil rouge of our work is to provide a classification of existing approaches in terms of the applications for which they have been employed. This differentiates our work from other surveys devoted to classify existing approaches on the basis of the algorithms, techniques and tools they use. We classified Web Data Extraction approaches into categories and, for each category, we illustrated the basic techniques along with their main variants. We grouped existing applications in two main areas: applications at the Enterprise level and at the Social Web level. Such a classification relies on a twofold reason: on one hand, Web Data Extraction techniques emerged as a key tool to perform data analysis in Business and Competitive Intelligence systems as well as for business process re-engineering. On the other hand, Web Data Extraction techniques allow for gathering a large amount of structured data continuously generated and disseminated by Web 2.0, Social Media and Online Social Network users and this offers unprecedented opportunities of analyzing human behaviors on a large scale. We discussed also about the potential of cross-fertilization, i.e., on the possibility of re-using Web Data Extraction techniques originally designed to work in a given domain, in other domains.},

Of the types of resources available on the web, weblogs are becoming increasingly important due to the continued growth of the blogosphere, but remain poorly explored. Past approaches to data extraction from weblogs have often involved manual intervention and suffer from low scalability. This paper proposes a fully automated information extraction methodology based on the use of web feeds and processing of {HTML.} The approach includes a model for generating a wrapper that exploits web feeds for deriving a set of extraction rules automatically. Instead of performing a pairwise comparison between posts, the model matches the values of the web feeds against their corresponding {HTML} elements retrieved from multiple weblog posts. It adopts a probabilistic approach for deriving a set of rules and automating the process of wrapper generation. An evaluation of the model is conducted on a dataset of 2,393 posts and the results (92\% accuracy) show that the proposed technique enables robust extraction of weblog properties and can be applied across the blogosphere for applications such as improved information retrieval and more robust web preservation initiatives.},

We examine issues  in the design of parallel systems and show  why the actor model is suitable for exploiting  large-scale parallelism. Concurrency in actors  is constrained only by the availability of  hardware resources and by the logical  dependence inherent in the computation.  Unlike dataflow and functional programming,  however, actors are dynamically  reconfigurable and can model shared  resources with changing local state.  Concurrency is spawned in actors using  asynchronous message-passing, pipelining,  and the dynamic creation of actors. This  thesis deals with some central issues in  distributed computing. Specifically, problems  of divergence and deadlock are addressed.  For example, actors permit dynamic deadlock  detection and removal. The problem of  divergence is contained because  independent transactions can execute  concurrently and potentially infinite processes  are nevertheless available for interaction.},

	abstract = {We survey the current techniques to cope with the problem of string matching that allows errors. This is becoming a more and more relevant issue for many fast growing areas such as information retrieval and computational biology. We focus on online searching and mostly on edit distance, explaining the problem and its relevance, its statistical behavior, its history and current developments, and the central ideas of the algorithms and their complexities. We present a number of experiments to compare the performance of the different algorithms and show which are the best choices. We conclude with some directions for future work and open problems.},
